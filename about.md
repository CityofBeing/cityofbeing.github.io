Welcome to my blog. If you’re here, you likely know me already, but, if not, my name is Josh Hogan, and I live in Atlanta, GA.

### What is "City of Being?"

### Why “Uncertain Pilgrim?”

The image of pilgrimage has long been one that has resonated with me.  Although I consider this earth to be my home, my sacred ground, I also believe that life is a journey of sorts.  I’m not even sure that it’s a journey to anything.  As in all pilgrimages, the journey is very often more important than the final destination. I’m not a stranger to this earth, but I am journeying through a life on it.

The “uncertain” part is not to be taken negatively.  I believe that absolute certainty is dangerous.  It amounts to a “clinging” to things – concepts, possessions, idols, whatever – and it can blind you to the important things along the path. I do not wish to finish my explorations or to close my mind to the wonder, miracles, pain, confusion, difficulties, or moments of joy that I encounter.  I do not wish to stick my stake in the ground and say, “This is it,” and stop growing.  By uncertain, I mean open-hearted, open-minded, open-armed.
