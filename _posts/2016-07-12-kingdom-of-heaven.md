<blockquote>The kingdom of heaven is not, for the Jewish Jesus of Nazareth, a piece of real estate for the single saved soul; it is a communal vision of what could be and what should be. Â It is a vision of a time when all debts are forgiven, when we stop judging others, when we not only wear our traditions on our sleeve, but we also hold them in our hearts and minds and enact them with all our strength.</blockquote>
--Amy-Jill Levine, The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus
