I sometimes like to dabble in found poetry.  If you are unfamiliar with this particular form of poetry, this is <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5780" target="_blank">a good definition</a> from Poets.org:
<div>"Found poems take existing texts and refashion them, reorder them, and present them as poems. The literary equivalent of a collage, found poetry is often made from newspaper articles, street signs, graffiti, speeches, letters, or even other poems."</div>
<div>I will post these experiments whether good or bad (probably mostly bad) here on this blog.  Without further ado, here is my first one on Uncertain Pilgrim.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Progress</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>The inevitability of Progress</div>
<div>        prepared us</div>
<div>to be frightened,</div>
<div>     to smell violence and</div>
<div>the bodies of dead animals and</div>
<div>            human pleasure</div>
<div>putrefying,</div>
<div>oblivious to the savageries</div>
<div>          of history.</div>
<div>-from <em>Sketches from Life: the Autobiography of Lewis Mumford</em>, p. 250</div>
