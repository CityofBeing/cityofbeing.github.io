<blockquote>"We can only learn and advance with contradictions. The faithful inside should meet the doubtful. The doubtful should meet the faithful. A human slowly advances and becomes mature when he accepts his contradictions." -- Shams of Tabriz

"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson</blockquote>
