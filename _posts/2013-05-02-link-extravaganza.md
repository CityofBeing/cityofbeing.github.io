	<li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-michael-dowd/idolatry-of-the-written-word_b_2832435.html" target="_blank">Idolatry of the Written Word</a> - Rev. Michael Dowd on why the Bible is pointing to God and is not actually God: "Alas, when a story becomes Scripture, it ceases to evolve -- at least in any functional, intentional way. Skillful and charismatic interpreters of unchanging Scripture can, of course, maintain the relevance of the sacred stories for a good deal longer by continuing to evolve the interpretations. Supposed miracles can be reinterpreted as metaphor; historical "fact" can be recast as value-laden parable. But when the interpretations themselves fall to the temptation of idolatry of the written word, absurdity eventually prevails."</li>
