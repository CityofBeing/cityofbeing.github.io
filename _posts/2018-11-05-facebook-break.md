I am the worst blogger. Ever.  I've decided to take an extended break from Facebook and other social media.  Especially since election season is going on, it's difficult to handle the constant stream of negative news and vitriol.  I intend to stay informed, but not through a social media platform.  I will continue to read good journalism from sites and sources such as Longreads, ProPublica, reliable newspaper websites, print magazines, and journals.  In essence, I want to go on a "News Diet" (and social media diet) in the vein of Rolf Debelli's essay ["Avoid News: Towards a Healthy News Diet](http://www.dobelli.com/en/essays/news-diet/).
