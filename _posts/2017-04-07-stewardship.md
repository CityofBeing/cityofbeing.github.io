How wonderful would it be to look back on your life and realize you had accomplished something like this couple in India?

I have said it before, but it's worth repeating.  We were made for this planet. We are to be true stewards of what we find because it doesn't "belong" to us, whatever that means in the context of our finite lives.  We belong to the Earth, and we can take that responsibility seriously, or we can ignore it at our peril.  This couple has made a serious effort to leave their part of the planet better off than when they found it.
