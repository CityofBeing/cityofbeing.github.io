I wrote this at Easter time a couple of years ago.  I still like some of it, but I now wish to rewrite it.
<h2>Nobody wants Jesus</h2>
Nobody wants Jesus to come.

Oh, we all say we do.

But we mean the Jesus

who looks like us,

who talks like us,

who carries our very own prejudices

in his heart.

&nbsp;

We don’t want the Jesus

Who, like His brother Thomas,

plunges His finger

into gaping wounds,

the ones in our sides.

That Jesus

asks too much.

&nbsp;

We don’t want the Jesus

Who has looked

into the eyes

of the wild God,

The Holy Mystery,

Who screams,” Love!”

from every rooftop.

&nbsp;

We don’t want the Jesus

Who didn’t care for empty piety,

Who desired more than sacrifice,

Who commanded mercy,

Who prayed for enemies,

Who loved the outcast--

The Beloved, enfleshed.

&nbsp;

With followers

like us,

it’s a wonder

He ever had to flee to the desert

for solitude.
