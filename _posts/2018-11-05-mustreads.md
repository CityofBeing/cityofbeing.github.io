I used to call these posts "Link Dumps."  These are the articles/websites I would have shared on social media if I were on there.  I'll provide the link with some commentary.
 
* ["The American Civil War Didn't End. And Trump is a Confederate President"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/04/the-american-civil-war-didnt-end-and-trump-is-a-confederate-president.) by Rebecca Solnit.  I've often said the same thing (i.e., that the war didn't really end; it just went underground), but I don't think I have said it quite this well.  I love this paragraph:

>As Michelle Alexander reminded us recently: “The whole of American history can be described as a struggle between those who truly embraced the revolutionary idea of freedom, equality and justice for all, and those who resisted.” She argues that we are not the resistance; we are the river that they are trying to dam; they are the resistance, the minority, the people trying to stop the flow of history.

* ["The social costs of ride-hailing may be larger than previously thought"](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/03/the-social-costs-of-ride-hailing-may-be-larger-than-previously-thought) The Economist seems to think this can be fixed, but I'm not so sure.  We need to be investing in public transportation, not handing our money over to gig economy entrepreneurs.
* ["Wait, Have We Really Wiped Out 60 Percent of Animals?"](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/have-we-really-killed-60-percent-animals-1970/574549/)  It's a mischaracterization to say, as some news outlets have, that humans have killed off a blanket 60% of all animals.  It isn't, however, wrong to say that we've precipitated a grave crisis for wildlife.
* [Zhuang Zi: A Funhouse Mirror for the Soul](https://aeon.co/classics/on-the-path-to-improvement-follow-the-jester-not-the-sage) I am more familiar with this work and its author as Chuang Tzu, but, however you spell it, the work truly is difficult, if not impossible, to truly unravel, and maybe that's the point.  As Thomas Merton said (as quoted in the article): "You enter upon this kind of way when you leave all ways and, in some sense, get lost."
