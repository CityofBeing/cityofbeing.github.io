There's not really much of a theme to these apart from being related to historical subjects in some way.
 
* ["Making an Ancient Roman Murderer"](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/making-ancient-roman-murderernd-trump-is-a-confederate-president)On the bizarre plot hatched by Emperor Nero to murder his mother, Agrippina.  Nero comes across as a bit of a hapless boob rather than a cunning schemer in the story.

* ["What Do Our Oldest Books Say About Us?"](https://newrepublic.com/article/152111/oldest-books-say-us
>These books should have been a mirror, some kind of catalyst to self-recognition. But when I looked at them I saw nothing. I only saw the yawning void of everything in human history that I cannot understand, everything that has been taken from our culture by the incredible acceleration of technology over the course of my lifetime.
* ["The Meek Shall Not Inherit The Earth — The Shepherds Will."](https://medium.com/dialogue-and-discourse/the-meek-shall-not-inherit-the-earth-the-shepherds-will-54d355a7754a)  The author argues that the translation of the "meek" inheriting the Earth is a mistranslation.  The Greek term, he argues, points more towards those who wield power in a way that serves the greater good, like a shepherd protecting sheep from lions and other predators.  Not being a Greek language scholar, I cannot independently verify the plausibility of the author's argument from that perspective.  It does, however, seem to make sense within the context of the larger story of Jesus, a person who had no qualms about smashing the money changers' tables - an example of power in service of the weak and downtrodden. Whatever the case, the piece highlights how sometimes we might miss critical cultural nuances, depending on the translation.
* ["A History of Monsters](https://aeon.co/essays/there-be-monsters-from-cabinets-of-curiosity-to-demons-within) "The word ‘monster’ derives from the Latin monstrare (to demonstrate) or monere (to warn). Yet defining monsters is difficult. They are a rambunctious lot, less identifiable by what they are than by what they do. According to the American art historian Asa Mittman: ‘Monsters do a great deal of cultural work, but they do not do it nicely.’"

Jesus as the Good Shepherd from the early Christian catacomb of Domitilla/Domatilla (Crypt of Lucina, 200-300 CE).
