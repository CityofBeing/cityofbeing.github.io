I love this passage from <a href="http://www.contemplative.org/cynthia.html" target="_blank">Cynthia Bourgeault</a>'s book, <a href="http://www.shambhala.com/the-wisdom-jesus.html" target="_blank"><em>The Wisdom Jesus</em></a>.
<blockquote>Would it be possible for us, too, to "become all flame?" Could our own lives become such a perfect fusion of infinite love and finite form that light would pour from our being as an actual physical radiance? I have indeed seen this light in more than a few realized masters toward the end of their earthly journeys; it is the fully revealed mystery of human life lived as a conscious sacrament. How we get there is the secret Jesus will unfold for us through the course of his own consciously sacramental life. But our first step in joining him on this journey is to recognize that his incarnation is not about fall, guilt, or blame, but about goodness, solidarity, and our own intimate participation in the mystery of love at the heart of all creation. (pp. 102-103)</blockquote>
Goodness, solidarity, intimate participation in the mystery of love.  This approach is so much more full and rich than the old-fashioned, unworthy sinners approach.  And I think it is what Jesus actually meant in his teachings.
