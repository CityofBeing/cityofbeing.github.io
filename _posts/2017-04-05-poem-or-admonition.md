Just to keep the poetry month theme going, here's a fridge magnet poem that is really only a general admonition to myself.

It does remind me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man" target="_blank">Green Man</a> archetype, an image to which I have long felt a connection.  Matthew Fox says that the Green Man reminds us to be "wet and juicy" and fully alive.  All living things are full of blood or sap or liquid of some kind.

The phrase "take and eat" also calls to mind the language of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist" target="_blank">Eucharist</a>, an invitation to share in a meal of Christ's body and blood.  It's also an invitation to a remembering (or, as <a href="http://www.contemplative.org/cynthia-bourgeault/" target="_blank">Cynthia Bourgeault</a> has said, "re - membering") of Jesus.  That ritual is intended to reconstitute the body of Christ in some way (depending on which denomination you fall into).  I don't want to get into that here, since I'm not a theologian, and this is hardly the point to this post.  I don't know if there is a point to this post.

Anyway, for your viewing pleasure, here is an image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Laurence%27s_Church,_Ludlow" target="_blank">Ludlow</a> Green Man in Shropshire, England.  I'm sure you'll agree he's a handsome fellow.
