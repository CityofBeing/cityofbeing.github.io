I love this quote from Francis Spufford:
<blockquote> The harms that Christianity has done throughout its history are obvious — in some cases they’re now the only thing people can see — and if you try to deny them, or to minimize them, or to make your stand for Christianity’s value on a squeaky-clean artificial version of its record, then you’re engaging in the maintenance of a cozy bubble-world. And Christianity pops bubbles. Its power lies in its realism. It acknowledges suffering, squalor and cruelty, including the suffering and squalor and cruelty caused by us Christians ourselves and our churches; it demands that we give those things their full weight of sorrow and culpability, and only then does it insist that the story isn’t over, that there is more to say. After Good Friday comes Easter Sunday. But you can’t fast forward through the ugliness. Clergy child abuse, zealous violence, homophobia, anti-Semitism: they’re all to be confessed, not excused. Whether people forgive us for them is up to them. We don’t get to demand forgiveness, or to hurry the conversation along to things we’re prouder of.</blockquote>
I definitely have to check out his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unapologetic-Francis-Spufford/dp/0571225217">Unapologetic</a>.
