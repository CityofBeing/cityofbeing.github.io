<blockquote>A Rabbi came to the prophet Elijah and asked, "Tell me, when will the Messiah come?" The reply, "Go ask him yourself," surprised the Rabbi. "Where is he?" he asked. "He's sitting at the gates of the city," Elijah said. "But how will I know which one he is?" the Rabbi inquired.

"He is sitting among the poor, covered with wounds. The others unbind all of their wounds all at one time and then bind them up again; but he unbinds his wounds one at a time and then binds that wound up again. He says to himself, 'Perhaps I shall be needed and I must always be ready.'"
</blockquote>--Henri Nouwen (via Molly Baskette)
