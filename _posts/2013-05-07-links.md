Here are some miscellaneous things I've been looking at on the web.

The pub where C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and their circle (<a href="http://www.mythsoc.org/inklings/" target="_blank">The Inklings</a>) attempted to achieve advanced states of mental incompetence while reading their works to one another. I've had a drink here. It's pretty cool.
