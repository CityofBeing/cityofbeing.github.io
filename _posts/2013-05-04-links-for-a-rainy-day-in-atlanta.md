Hi all,

Just got back from a workshop on film and media preservation in Athens, GA.  Their <a href="http://www.libs.uga.edu/scl/facilities/building.html" target="_blank">special collections library</a> is fantastic.  It includes 30,000 square feet of climate controlled storage vaults.  It's raining and dreary in Atlanta, so here are some websites I've been looking at to pass the time.

<a href="http://io9.com/5963263/how-nasa-will-build-its-very-first-warp-drive" target="_blank">How NASA might build its very first warp drive</a> - I'm a sucker for Star Trek stuff.

<a href="http://www.designboom.com/architecture/low-cost-house-for-middle-vietnam/" target="_blank">Low-cost Bamboo Housing in Vietnam</a> - I want - nay, need - one of these.

<a href="http://grist.org/living/flower-power-fighting-the-man-with-guerrilla-gardens/" target="_blank">Guerilla Gardening</a> - I've still got a couple of acorns from Earth Day that I need to plant surreptitiously somewhere.

<a href="http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm/" target="_blank">The World as I see it by Albert Einstein</a> - 'nuff said.

Stay dry, y'all!
