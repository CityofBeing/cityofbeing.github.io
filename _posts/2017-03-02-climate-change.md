I'm surprised this site hasn't been scrubbed, yet, by the new administration.  Perhaps it needs to be saved by us librarians before that happens.  It's a nice little overview of the evidence for Anthropogenic Climate Change.

<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" target="_blank">https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</a>

Here are some highlights:
<ul>
	<li>Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century. The rate in the last decade, however, is nearly double that of the last century.</li>
	<li>The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005.</li>
	<li>Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.</li>
	<li>Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier.</li>
</ul>
This is our home, and we are wrecking it. We are sleepwalking to a world of suffering and misery, not just for ourselves, but for all living beings.  It is imperative that we wake up and start living lives compatible with stewardship and healthy relationship with our planet.
