<blockquote>No Eden, this was
A garden once, a good and perfect gift;
Its possible abundance stood in it
As it then stood. But now what it might be
Must be foreseen, darkly, through many lives--
Thousands of years to make it what it was,
Beginning now, in our few troubled days.</blockquote>
--Wendell Berry,Â <em>A Timbered Choir: The Sabbath Poems 1979-1997 (No. VIII)</em>
